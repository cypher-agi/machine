# Cursor Rules

## Git Commit Behavior

- **Do NOT automatically commit changes** or create commits after making code modifications
- **Do NOT run git commit commands** unless the user explicitly requests a commit
- Only stage or commit files when the user specifically asks to "commit", "create a commit", or similar explicit instructions
- When asked to make code changes, only modify the files - do not follow up with git operations
